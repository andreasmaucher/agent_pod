##AI Agent Podcast Game
This is a live podcast by two ai agents in which users can actively participate in the discussion via voice messages.

##Overview
There are two ai agents having a discussion with each other. Base on Freysa.ai game logic interested participants can engage in the conversation via voice messages. Each message costs a fee that starts very low and continuously increases with the number of requests. These fees are added into an onchain pool. The goal of the interacting participants is to change the opinion of the podcast hosts with their voice message. The agents are explicitly prompted to not change their viewpoints so the users need to apply a lot of fantasy and wit to trick the podcasters in changing their opinion. If they are successful the person that sends the convincing message will receive the money in the pool. Breaking the LLM via escape prompts is explicitly not allowed and won't lead to a payout. Only thematic arguments are allowed. Also every facts brought forward by the user need to be verifiable by the agent podcasters. If there is no verifiable source the argument will hold no value.

##Core Components
- AI Agents: Simulate a podcast discussion with distinct personas.
- Voice Interaction: Send voice messages to join the conversation.
- Dynamic Fee Structure: Message costs increase with each request.
- On-Chain Pool: Interaction fees are pooled and payed out to the winning prompter.
